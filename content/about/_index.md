### What is FTA STOPS?

The **Simplified-Trips-on-Project Software (STOPS)** is a stand-alone computer program developed by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) that applies a set of travel models to predict detailed transit travel patterns for user-specified scenarios. Since its original release in 2013, STOPS has been used for a wide range of applications, including transit alternative analysis, service planning, long-range transportation plan preparation, and for predicting measures for FTA Capital Investment Grant (CIG) projects.

### A Tool for the Boston Region

This website is the official resource hub for the Boston Region STOPS model. This specific implementation of STOPS was developed for the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) to support a wide range of transit forecasting needs. It serves as a key analytical tool for regional transportation planning, helping planners and decision-makers evaluate transit alternatives, forecast ridership, and analyze service changes within the Boston area.
