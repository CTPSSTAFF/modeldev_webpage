The **Simplified-Trips-on-Project Software (STOPS)** is a stand-alone computer program developed by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) that applies a set of travel models to predict detailed transit travel patterns for user-specified scenarios.

Since its original release in 2013, STOPS has been used for a wide range of applications, including transit alternative analysis, service planning, long-range transportation planning, and for predicting measures for FTA Capital Investment Grant (CIG) projects.

STOPS has four main approaches for developing an application:

* **Synthetic:** Relies on Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) data and demographic data from a regional travel model to estimate transit trips. This approach is mainly used when very sparse or no data regarding actual transit travel patterns is available.
* **Incremental:** Relies on data from a comprehensive transit origin-destination on-board survey as the basis for developing person trips and calibrating the model.
* **Synthetic with Special Markets:** Uses the "Synthetic" approach but supplements it with data for distinct travel patterns not captured by CTPP data, such as large airports, universities, or tourist areas.
* **Synthetic + Incremental:** Combines both approaches, suitable for when a transit survey exists but the modeling area needs to be larger to cover a full project service area.
