This document describes the development of the Boston Regional STOPS Model.

### STOPS Overview

The Simplified-Trips-on-Project Software (STOPS) is a stand-alone computer program developed by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) that applies a set of travel models to predict detailed transit travel patterns for user-specified scenarios. It is a simplified method that project sponsors can use to predict trips-on-project measures and changes in Vehicle Miles of Travel (VMT).

Since its initial release in 2013, STOPS has been used for a wide range of applications, including:
- Transit alternative analysis
- Service planning
- Long-range transportation planning
- Ridership forecasts for FTA Capital Investment Grant (CIG) applications
