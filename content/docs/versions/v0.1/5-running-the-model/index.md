---

This guide outlines the steps for executing an initial run of the Boston Regional STOPS model, based on the official STOPS User Guide.

### Model Setup
- Extract model files to a high-level directory (e.g., `C:\BostonSTOPS`).
- Ensure no blank spaces are in the file path.
- Launch `STOPSMenu.exe` and link the appropriate GIS and Python executables.

### Data Preparation
- Run **Steps 7, 9, and 10** individually from the STOPS menu.
- The status for each step will update to ‘FILES FOUND!’ upon successful completion.

### Run Batch Steps
- Execute the model by selecting **Step 11**, which runs all remaining batch processes.
- A full run for the Boston Regional model typically takes approximately five hours.

### Report Results
- After the run is complete, review results by selecting **Step 12**.
- Results can also be viewed directly by opening the text files in the `Reports` folder.
