This chapter documents the steps to complete the initial runs of the Boston Regional STOPS Model.

### 2.1 Model Setup
The model files should be extracted to a high-level directory, such as `C:\BostonSTOPS`. It is recommended that the full Windows file path contain no blank spaces. After launching `STOPSMenu.exe`, the user must link the appropriate GIS and Python executables.

### 2.2 Data Preparation Steps
After completing the model setup, users should perform a preliminary run of STOPS Steps 7 through 10 on the STOPS menu.

### 2.3 Run Batch Steps
After completing the data preparation, the model can be executed by selecting Step 11, which runs all remaining batch processes. A full run typically takes approximately five hours.

### 2.4 Report Results
After the model run is complete, results can be reviewed by selecting Step 12 on the STOPS menu or by navigating to the 'Reports' folder.
