As part of the upcoming official release, Model Version 1.1 has been developed to incorporate a new theoretical GTFS fileset representing the planned **Spring 2025 service changes**.

This allows for scenario analysis and comparison against the v1.0 baseline. The primary changes in this version are limited to the transit network inputs. All other model application steps remain consistent with Version 1.0.
