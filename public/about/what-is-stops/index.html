<p>Since its original release in 2013, STOPS has been used for a wide range of applications, including transit alternative analysis, service planning, long-range transportation planning, and for predicting measures for FTA Capital Investment Grant (CIG) projects.</p>
<p>STOPS has four main approaches for developing an application:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synthetic:</strong> Relies on Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) data and demographic data from a regional travel model to estimate transit trips. This approach is mainly used when very sparse or no data regarding actual transit travel patterns is available.</li>
<li><strong>Incremental:</strong> Relies on data from a comprehensive transit origin-destination on-board survey as the basis for developing person trips and calibrating the model.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic with Special Markets:</strong> Uses the &ldquo;Synthetic&rdquo; approach but supplements it with data for distinct travel patterns not captured by CTPP data, such as large airports, universities, or tourist areas.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic + Incremental:</strong> Combines both approaches, suitable for when a transit survey exists but the modeling area needs to be larger to cover a full project service area.</li>
