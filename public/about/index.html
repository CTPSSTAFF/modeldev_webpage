<p>The <strong>Simplified-Trips-on-Project Software (STOPS)</strong> is a stand-alone computer program developed by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) that applies a set of travel models to predict detailed transit travel patterns for user-specified scenarios. Since its original release in 2013, STOPS has been used for a wide range of applications, including transit alternative analysis, service planning, long-range transportation plan preparation, and for predicting measures for FTA Capital Investment Grant (CIG) projects.</p>
<h3 id="a-tool-for-the-boston-region">A Tool for the Boston Region</h3>
<p>This website is the official resource hub for the Boston Region STOPS model. This specific implementation of STOPS was developed for the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) to support a wide range of transit forecasting needs. It serves as a key analytical tool for regional transportation planning, helping planners and decision-makers evaluate transit alternatives, forecast ridership, and analyze service changes within the Boston area.</p>
