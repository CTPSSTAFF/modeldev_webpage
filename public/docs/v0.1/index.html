<h3 id="stops-overview">STOPS Overview</h3>
<p>The Simplified-Trips-on-Project Software (STOPS) is a stand-alone computer program developed by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) that applies a set of travel models to predict detailed transit travel patterns for user-specified scenarios. It is a simplified method that project sponsors can use to predict trips-on-project measures and changes in Vehicle Miles of Travel (VMT).</p>
<p>Since its initial release in 2013, STOPS has been used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transit alternative analysis</li>
<li>Service planning</li>
<li>Long-range transportation planning</li>
<li>Ridership forecasts for FTA Capital Investment Grant (CIG) applications</li>
</ul>

              <div class="f6 nested-links">
                <p>The Boston Regional STOPS model has a specific configuration tailored to the region&rsquo;s geography and transit systems.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-area">Modeling Area</h3>
<p>The geographic coverage of the model includes the states of <strong>Massachusetts (MA)</strong>, <strong>Rhode Island (RI)</strong>, and <strong>New Hampshire (NH)</strong>, generally aligning with the latest regional travel demand model. STOPS only analyzes zones whose centroids fall within 25 miles of an active transit stop.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-approach">Modeling Approach</h3>
<p>The model uses the <strong>“Synthetic with Special Markets”</strong> approach. This method was chosen due to the absence of a recent, comprehensive origin-destination on-board survey. The &ldquo;Synthetic&rdquo; method, which uses census data, was supplemented with a special market trip table for travelers using Boston Logan International Airport. The model reflects average weekday ridership in fall 2024.</p>
<h3 id="district-system">District System</h3>
<p>STOPS uses districts to group Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) for scaling trip data and for reporting outputs. The districts in this model are defined to align with the boundaries used in the regional travel demand model, with a total of <strong>35 districts</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="fixed-guideway-settings-fgs">Fixed Guideway Settings (FGS)</h3>
<p>FGS values approximate the perceived benefits of fixed-guideway transit (like rail) compared to regular bus service.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full FGS</strong> is applied to all existing heavy rail, light rail, commuter rail, and ferry services.</li>
<li><strong>Partial FGS</strong> applies to services like Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). No routes are currently assigned a Partial FGS in this model.</li>

                <p>This chapter describes the sources of the key input data used to develop the Boston Regional STOPS Model using STOPS version 2.53.</p>
<h3 id="analysis-years">Analysis Years</h3>
<p>The model is configured for several analysis years:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Year:</strong> 2024 (the calibration year)</li>
<li><strong>10-Year Horizon:</strong> 2045 (to align with FTA CIG project requirements)</li>
<li><strong>20-Year Horizon:</strong> 2050 (aligning with the region&rsquo;s Long-Range Transportation Plan)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mpo-data">MPO Data</h3>
<p>STOPS requires TAZ-level population and employment data and zone-to-zone auto travel times and distances as inputs. These are obtained from the Boston Region MPO&rsquo;s regional travel demand model for the years 2019 (as a proxy for 2024) and 2050.</p>
<h3 id="transit-network-gtfs">Transit Network (GTFS)</h3>
<p>The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format represents the transit network. The model includes Fall 2024 GTFS data for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)</li>
<li>Brockton Area Transit Authority (BATA)</li>
<li>Cape Ann Transportation Authority (CATA)</li>
<li>Merrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority (MVRTA)</li>
<li>MetroWest Regional Transit Authority (MWRTA)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="existing-ridership-data">Existing Ridership Data</h3>
<p>The model calibration target for current year regional weekday unlinked transit trips is set at <strong>887,322 boardings</strong>, based on Fall 2024 data from the MBTA, National Transit Database (NTD), and other sources.</p>
<h3 id="other-key-input-files">Other Key Input Files</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Special Market File:</strong> A file containing zone-to-zone transit trips for air passengers traveling to/from Logan Airport.</li>
<li><strong>Station Shape File:</strong> Includes locations and attributes for every transit stop in the region.</li>
<li><strong>Walk Links File:</strong> A hybrid pedestrian network representing walk access to the transit system.</li>
<li><strong>Fare Structure File:</strong> A simplified representation of the region’s transit fare system.</li>

<h3 id="calibration-adjustments">Calibration Adjustments</h3>
<p>To calibrate the model to local conditions, several adjustments were made to STOPS parameters and input files, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transfer Penalty:</strong> Adjusted to 3.0 minutes to reflect the difficulty of transferring between routes.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Time Adjustment:</strong> Constants and factors were applied to normalize MPO travel times to observed congested highway travel times.</li>
<li><strong>ACS Zone Splits:</strong> Several large census zones were split to align more closely with the TAZ boundaries, adding approximately 900 zones.</li>
<li><strong>Fare File:</strong> The value of time (VOT) was increased, and ferry/commuter rail fares were adjusted to reflect monthly pass rates.</li>
<li><strong>Station Penalties:</strong> Penalties were added at many park-and-ride (PNR) lots to reflect actual parking capacities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="calibration-results">Calibration Results</h3>
<p>The calibration results reflect ridership on an average weekday in September/October 2024. The model was compared against observed data from sources like the 2023 MBTA Passenger Survey. STOPS produces boarding estimates by mode (Heavy Rail, Light Rail, Bus, etc.) that closely match the observed values for the MBTA and other regional transit agencies.</p>

<h3 id="model-setup">Model Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li>Extract model files to a high-level directory (e.g., <code>C:\BostonSTOPS</code>).</li>

                <p>This chapter presents a test application of the Boston Regional STOPS model for a corridor and provides horizon year forecasts.</p>
<h3 id="example-corridor-calibration">Example: Corridor Calibration</h3>
<p>Before applying the model to a specific corridor (e.g., Blue Hill Avenue), inputs and results must be reviewed to ensure consistency with local conditions. This can involve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolating specific routes (e.g., fare-free buses) in a new GTFS folder.</li>
<li>Updating the STOPS parameter file and fare file to reflect the new GTFS.</li>
<li>Updating district definitions and station groupings to provide more geographic detail.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sensitivity-tests">Sensitivity Tests</h3>
<p>Tests were conducted to see how changes to service affect model outputs. Results confirmed that the calibrated model responds plausibly to service and operating changes, such as frequency reductions or travel time improvements.</p>
<h3 id="horizon-year-forecasts">Horizon Year Forecasts</h3>
<p>The model includes ridership forecasts for the years 2045 and 2050, accounting for projected changes in population, employment, and the transit network.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2045 Forecast:</strong> Regional transit boardings are forecasted to increase by <strong>38%</strong> compared to 2024.</li>
<li><strong>2050 Forecast:</strong> Regional transit boardings are forecasted to increase by <strong>43%</strong> compared to 2024.</li>
